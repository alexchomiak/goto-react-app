# GoTo React App

GoTo React app is a simple lightweight boilerplate React application that comes bundled with React, Redux and ReactRouter. It is an ongoing project, please leave any ideas for improvement below.

## Ease of use

I created an npm module similar to CRA that you can use to quickly initialize a project as opposed to cloning this repo everytime. (Which is what the module does, but who wants to remember this repo? )

```
npm i -g goto-react-app
```

Usage

```
goto-react-app <project_name>
```

## Commands

```
# dev environment
npm run start

# prod build
npm run build

# compile library
npm run buildlib
```
